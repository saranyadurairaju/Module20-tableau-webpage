## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
This project aims to deliver personalized beer recommendations to beer lovers across the country. Our final product consists of web scraped data, item-based collaborative filtering models using nearest neighbor collaborative filtering and latent factor collaborative filtering, all packed into an interactive Flask web-application. Our purpose is twofold: to create a recommender system of something fun for others to use and in the process learn how to build a complex recommender system.
  
## <a name="machine-learning"></a>Methods of Recommendation

#### <a name="similarity-based"></a>Based on Similarity
This recommendation will be based on similarity between beers. Select one of the beers you like and a factor you think is the most important between flavor, aroma and texture for the beer. 

#### <a name="ratings-based"></a>Based on Ratings
This recommendation will be based on your ratings for three beers that you choose to rate. Select three beers you know and rate them - ratings can be between 1 to 5.
